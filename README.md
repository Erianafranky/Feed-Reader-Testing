# Feed-Reader-Testing
A web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite. Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and left the application with an incomplete test suite which I had to complete.

**How to run the project**

1 Clone or download the project in your local machine 
2 Open index.html, you should be able to see the feeds

**Run on a server**

1. Run npm install -g http-server
2. Run http-server -o in the directory of the project.
